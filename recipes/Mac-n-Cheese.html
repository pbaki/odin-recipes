    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (32 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 cups small curd cottage cheese, divided</li>
            <li>5 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from heat.</li>
                <li>Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.</li>
                <li>Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
